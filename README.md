## Dinamic Object Following Robot
Objects using blue color, in webots simulation. The robot uses Khepera IV, for both robots as a moving object target and the main robot, because the Khepera IV robot has a blue color on its body. The webots environment must reduce the blue color so that object detection in the camera does not occur interference. The data generated when the simulation runs is entered in a csv file to be analyzed in an ipynb file using jupyterlab.
